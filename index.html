    <h2>What is PCMSapplyValues?</h2>
        <p>PCMSapplyValues is a political compass test, that edits & expands the questions of the original <a href="http://sapplypoliticalcompass.com/">Sapply test</a>* and <a href="https://m1omg.github.io/SapplyValues.github.io/index.html">Shodan Values</a> with the UI of <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a>. All for the purpose of the PCM discord server and others to use. You will be presented a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be displayed on a political compass.<br /><br />
        * A few questions have been reworded from there original wording.</br></br>
        There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>
    <h2>Why use this version?</h2>
    <p>This is a test for pepole who know the original test and see flaws in it's method for assigning values. The political compass while meme filled is not peferct, never will be. As such the PCM discord server has taken messures to make the test more nuanced and accurate. 
	    This test asumes you know a decent amout about politics. If there are any terms you feel you do not understand ethier look them up or answer netural to push though the test.
     This tets supports URL parameters, meaning you can easily share the link to your results and if you lose the image, you can find the results page entry with parameters in your history so you don't have to retake the whole test.</br></br>
    <h2>Your questions / results suck!</h2>
    <p>If there is an issue with the test in a manner you feel it is baised or incorect some of the blame is on the original test and some of it on the compass. Aporximately 9 questions were rewriten & 4 created by the server</p>
